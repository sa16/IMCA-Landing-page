            <p>The campaign... is one of the best FPS campaigns, again since reach. Wow it is good! Boss battles, great and diverse level design, a good story, with some really touching moments. This is a must play for sure! - IMDB Users Review</p>

            <p>It’s criminal that still, so few people seem to have played this game – the short-but-sweet campaign is genuinely one of the very best FPS campaigns I have ever played; definitely one of the finest released in the last generation. - Midlifegamergeek.com</p>

            <p>Playing through the approximately six-hour campaign I was impressed that each level felt big enough for me to sprint, hurdle, double-jump, and wall-run through while also being well enough organized that I never felt lost - IGN.com</p>

            <p>Titanfall 2's campaign is fast, it's responsive, and it lets you move like John Woo's most violent dreams of the future. If you've played Mirror's Edge and wished more games would learn from it, this is what you've been looking for. - Wired Magazine</p>
